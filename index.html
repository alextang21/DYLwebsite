            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><span>What if you approached your life as a series of design projects? What if there were a class to help you explore the bigger issues of finding your way to a career you&#8217;ll love, and space to work on crafting a total life that feels &#8220;like you&#8221;? Inspired by Stanford&#8217;s wildly popular class of the same name, this course includes seminar-style discussions, role-playing, short writing assignments, hands-on making, guest speakers, and individual mentoring and coaching. Small group discussions will be held during a separate lab time of each team&#8217;s choosing. This class is open to <b>all juniors and seniors of any major</b>; no prerequisites. Enrollment is limited and we strive to create a robust class across a range of majors and backgrounds.
